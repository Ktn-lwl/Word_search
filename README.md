# Word_search
Generate/solve a word search puzzle
This is my first full project in Python. I'm trying to write code that takes 
a set of words as input and builds a word search puzzle from them. I only 
have a vague idea of what I'm doing, so I'm just making it up as I go along.
My logic and time complexity may be shoddy in some areas, but I will refactor
sections of my code as I go along. I've decided to make a solver first, because
that seems easier than a puzzle generator.
